The main thrust of my research focuses on integrating novel spatial data alongside historical and contemporary census records to investigate urban and environmental change over the long term. This research is enabled by historical social-environmental data extraction techniques using a variety of computational methods (see <a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0255507">this article</a> on machine learning approaches to data extraction, as well as the [_Socio-ecological City Project_]({{< ref pvd.md>}})). Most recently, these approaches have allowed me to consider the role of industrial risk in the initial formation of racial segregation in US cities going back to the late 19th century (see 
<a target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23780231221127541">this article</a>). As part of this work, I have also collaborated with state agencies to identify risks posed by legacy industrial contamination (see <a target="_blank" href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/env.2021.0121">this article</a>). 

I also have experience in field interviews and mixed qualitative analysis. I conducted semi-structured interviews in Anchorage, Fairbanks, and rural villages in Alaska, and integrated these interview data with planning reports, court cases, and gray literature as part of two articles (<a target="_blank" href="https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/JPE/article/view/23828">1</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0306312718803453">2</a>) on contested environmental knowledge production and anti-extraction movements. As part of a separate project, I drew on qualitative coding techniques to understand US media coverage of the sociotechnical controversies surrounding the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan (see <a target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963662520936186?casa_token=U90UE5iANX0AAAAA%3ASB_BL79FhIZIUBCcSE7WVJXnsEvJLeDmsBo9ZIiRPl4oSPXVSsGIkrp3N6TGrEwG005plZdjFOEsoQ">this article</a>).

I use a variety of tools in my research, including:

&nbsp; \+  Machine learning approaches to data extraction

&nbsp; \+  Data scraping and automation in *Python*

&nbsp; \+  Computational text analysis in *Python* and *R*

&nbsp; \+  Spatial analysis in *R*, *ArcGIS*, and *QGIS*

&nbsp; \+  Qualitative analysis in *NVivo* and *HyperResearch*
