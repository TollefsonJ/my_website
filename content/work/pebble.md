This article examines the social, historical and political constitution of land and resource imaginaries in Bristol Bay, Alaska. We compare the dynamics of these different imaginaries in the region within the early permitting debates concerning the proposed Pebble Mine to understand the contemporary politics  of  defining  and  constructing  ideologies  of  extractive  resource  use.  We  show  that  the  civic  epistemologies  and  ontologies  embedded  in  different  social,  scientific  and  political  practices  help  explain  environmental  actions  and  outcomes.  We  demonstrate  that  the  contested  fields  of  social imagination allow for resource exploitation – commodification, extraction and profit – that endangers nature, but also allow for building alternative imaginaries and constructions of land and value  as  key  components  of  environmental  justice  and  land  sovereignty  initiatives.  Contestations  can  also  highlight  problematic  and  unjust  resource  practices  that  disenfranchise  and  destabilize  subordinate industries, poor communities, indigenous lands and subsistence or renewable resource use.  These  divergent  discourses,  and  the  deliberative  valuations  of  alternative  futures  that  they  contribute to, are not effectively considered in Alaska’s large mine permitting process.
