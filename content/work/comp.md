US cities contain unknown numbers of undocumented sites that are legacies of the “manufactured gas” industry that dominated energy production during the late-19th and early-20th centuries. While many of these unidentified sites likely contain significant levels of highly toxic and biologically persistent contamination, locating them remains a significant challenge. We propose a new method to efficiently identify manufactured gas production, storage, and distribution infrastructure in bulk by applying feature extraction and machine learning techniques to publicly-available scans of historic Sanborn fire insurance maps. Our approach, which relies on a convolutional neural network to classify circular map features, increases the rate of MGP identification 20-fold compared to unaided visual coding while maintaining a recall rate of nearly 90%.
