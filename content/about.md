I'm a PhD student at the Brown University Department of Sociology. My current research draws on computational methods to build out a [historical environmental geography of the manufactured gas industry]({{<ref "fmgp.md">}}). I've also done work on the [political ecology and human geography of Northern resource extraction]({{<ref "pebble.md">}}), [nuclear discourse and public understanding of sociotechnical controversies]({{<ref "fukushima.md">}}), [and the politics of environmental knowledge production in remote environmental impact assessment]({{<ref "donlin.md">}}).
