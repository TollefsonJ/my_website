I'm a PhD student at the Brown University Department of Sociology. My current research draws on computational methods to build out a historical environmental geography of the manufactured gas industry. I've also done work on the political ecology and human geography of Northern resource extraction, nuclear discourse and public understanding of sociotechnical controversies, and the politics of environmental knowledge production in remote environmental impact assessment.

- [Spatial analysis of former manufactured gas sites]({{< ref fmgp_method.md >}})\
Uses computational methods to identify legacy fossil fuel infrastructure in US cities.

- [Political ecology of large mine permitting]({{< ref alaska.md >}})\
Two linked projects on environmental knowledge production and local resistance to the proposed Pebble and Donlin mines in rural Alaska.

- [Technoscience discourse and the Fukushima nuclear disaster]({{< ref fukushima.md >}})\
Argues that post-Fukushima media discourse worked to rebuild trust in nuclear power and expertise in part by delegitimizing non-expert engagement with nuclear energy issues.
