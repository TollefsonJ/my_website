# Bio

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation and the Department of Sociology at the University of Chicago. My research uses computational, spatial, quantitative, and historical methods to investigate pressing social-environmental questions, with a focus on inequality, urbanization, environmental justice, and climate change. I also examine related questions from a science and society perspective, drawing on mixed methods approaches alongside computational and network analysis techniques.
