## Urban environments and neighborhood formation
My primary research investigates the formation and development of racial-environmental inequality in cities, linking spatial, quantitative, and computational and machine learning methods to produce novel longitudinal data. My dissertation presents the first analysis of urban environmental inequality in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, corresponding to the initial formation of neighborhood-scale racial segregation. This research is enabled by historical social-environmental data extraction techniques using a variety of computational methods (see <a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0255507">this article</a> on machine learning approaches to data extraction. In a case study of the Providence, RI, area, I find that environmental inequality shifted from a class-based phenomenon to one structured primarily by race and ethnicity, as residential segregation began to solidify at the neighborhood level at the turn of the 20th century (see 
<a target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23780231221127541">this article</a>). My dissertation extends this research to a comparative sample of US cities, and finds that racialization of environmental inequality emerged alongside and in relation to the formation of segregated and unequal neighborhoods. Supported by a research award from the Socio-Environmental Knowledge Commons, I am extending this work to a broad census of U.S. urban energy production during the height of industrialization and urbanization in the early 20th century.

## Land use and inequality
A second area of my research focuses on localized processes of social-environmental change in cities over the course of the 20th century. Two projects, conducted in collaboration with the Community Engagement Core of the Superfund Research Program at Brown University and the Rhode Island Department of Health, analyze of the interaction between urban greening and postindustrial abandonment (see  <a target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/15356841231152616">this article in *City & Community*</a>) and the multiplicative effects of race, ethnicity, and school type in unequal geographies of environmental health risk among school-age children (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/env.2021.0121">see this article in *Environmental Justice*</a>). Together, these projects reveal how complex interactions between diverse forms of urban land use and iterative population change may reshape local structures of inequality over time, with important implications for racial, enviornmental, and health justice. 

## Community resilience
A third area of my work uses novel computational text analysis approaches to map the knowledge networks that make up the climate and community resilience planning fields, through an ongoing collaboration with research economists at the Engineering Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Our recent systematic review identifies a generational shift toward predictive modeling approaches and away from the conceptual and theoretical literatures that formed the early basis of the field (<a target="_blank" href="https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcc.70015">see this article in *WIREs Climate Change*</a>). We are continuing this line of work in two directions: First, to map the conceptual relationship between climate resilience and adaptation frameworks; and, second, to understand the circulation of knowledge between academic and policy communities, taking advantage of large-scale data on city, state, and federal policy documents.
