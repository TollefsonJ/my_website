# Environmental Roots of Urban Inequality
My primary research investigates the formation and development of racial-environmental inequality in cities, linking spatial, quantitative, and computational and machine learning methods to produce novel longitudinal data. This research is enabled by historical social-environmental data extraction techniques using a variety of computational methods (see <a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0255507">this article</a> on machine learning approaches to analyzing archival data). In a case study of the Providence, RI, area, I find that environmental inequality shifted from a class-based phenomenon to one structured primarily by race and ethnicity, as residential segregation began to solidify at the neighborhood level at the turn of the 20th century (see 
<a target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23780231221127541">this article</a>). My dissertation extends this research to conduct the first comparative analysis of urban environmental inequality in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. I find that the racialization of environmental inequality emerged alongside and in relation to the initial formation of segregated and unequal neighborhoods.
