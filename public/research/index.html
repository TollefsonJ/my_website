<p>I am a PhD candidate at the Brown University Department of Sociology and the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society. My research uses computational, spatial, quantitative, and historical methods to investigate pressing social-environmental questions, with a focus on inequality, urbanization, environmental justice, and climate change. I also examine related questions from a science and society perspective, drawing on mixed methods approaches alongside computational and network analysis techniques.</p>
<p>â–¼ <a href="/"><strong>research</strong></a></p>
<p>My current research investigates the formation and development of racial-environmental inequality in cities, linking spatial, quantitative, and computational and machine learning methods to produce novel longitudinal data. Other strands of my research seek to understand how society-environment interactions shape the emergence and continuation of social, political, and spatial forms of inequality over time. A third area of my work focuses on the social and political dynamics of knowledge, computation, and quantification.</p>
<p>My dissertation presents the first analysis of urban environmental inequality in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, corresponding to the initial formation of neighborhood-scale racial segregation. This research is enabled by historical social-environmental data extraction techniques using a variety of computational methods (see <a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0255507">this article</a> on machine learning approaches to data extraction, as well as the <a href="http://localhost:33983/work/pvd/"><em>Socio-ecological City Project</em></a>). In a case study of the Providence, RI, area, I find that environmental inequality shifted from a class-based phenomenon to one structured primarily by race and ethnicity, as residential segregation began to solidify at the neighborhood level at the turn of the 20th century (see
<a target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23780231221127541">this article</a>). My dissertation extends this research to a comparative sample of US cities, and finds that the racialization of enviornmental inequality emerged alongside and in relation to the formation of segregated and unequal neighborhoods. Related strands of my research investigate complex interactions in the spatial dynamics of environmental privilege and risk over time, with a focus post-industrial and contemporary patterns of urban inequality (see  <a target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/15356841231152616">this article</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/env.2021.0121">this article</a>).</p>
<p>I also have experience in field interviews and mixed qualitative analysis. I conducted semi-structured interviews in Anchorage, Fairbanks, and southwestern Alaska, and integrated these interview data with planning reports, court cases, and gray literature as part of two articles (<a target="_blank" href="https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/JPE/article/view/23828">article 1</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0306312718803453">article 2</a>) on contested environmental knowledge production and anti-extraction movements. As part of a separate project, I drew on qualitative coding techniques to understand US media coverage of the sociotechnical controversies surrounding the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan (see <a target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963662520936186?casa_token=U90UE5iANX0AAAAA%3ASB_BL79FhIZIUBCcSE7WVJXnsEvJLeDmsBo9ZIiRPl4oSPXVSsGIkrp3N6TGrEwG005plZdjFOEsoQ">this article</a>).</p>
