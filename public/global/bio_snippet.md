I am a PhD candidate at the Brown University Department of Sociology and the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society. My research uses computational, spatial, quantitative, and historical methods to investigate pressing social-environmental questions, with a focus on inequality, urbanization, environmental justice, and climate change. I also examine related questions from a science and society perspective, drawing on mixed methods approaches alongside computational and network analysis techniques.
