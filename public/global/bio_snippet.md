I am a PhD candidate at the Brown University Department of Sociology and the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society. My research uses computational, spatial, quantitative, and historical methods to investigate longstanding sociological questions, with a focus on the role of socio-environmental processes in persistent patterns of urban inequality. I also examine related questions from a science and society perspective, drawing on mixed methods approaches alongside computational and network analysis techniques.
