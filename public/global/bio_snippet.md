I'm a PhD candidate at the Brown University Department of Sociology. My research uses computational, spatial, and quantitative methods to investigate core sociological questions, with a focus on long-term trajectories of social and environmental change in cities. I also have an enduring interest in political ecology and science and technology studies. Check out my work using the links below. Thanks for visiting!
