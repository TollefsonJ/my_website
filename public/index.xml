Socio-ecological city project
PI: Scott Frickel. Collaborators: Summer Gonsalves, Thomas Marlow
This page presents collaborative work by the Community Engagement Core of the Brown University branch of the Superfund Research Program. We are collecting a wide array of longitudinal spatial data on the industrial, environmental, and social history of the Providence, RI area. Check out some of these data below (particularly manufacturing and hazardous business data, from Tom&amp;rsquo;s recent work and dissertation).</description>
