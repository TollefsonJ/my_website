      <description>&amp;ndash; back to previous page &amp;ndash;&#xA;Socio-ecological city project&#xA;PI: Scott Frickel. Collaborators: Summer Gonsalves, Thomas Marlow&#xA;This page presents collaborative work by the Community Engagement Core of the Brown University branch of the Superfund Research Program. We are collecting a wide array of longitudinal spatial data on the industrial, environmental, and social history of the Providence, RI area. Check out some of these data below (particularly manufacturing and hazardous business data, from Tom&amp;rsquo;s recent work and dissertation).</description>

      <description>+ jonathan tollefson +&#xA;1 bio&#xA;I am an incoming Postdoctoral Fellow at the Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation and the Department of Sociology at the University of Chicago. My research uses computational, spatial, quantitative, and historical methods to investigate pressing social-environmental questions, with a focus on inequality, urbanization, environmental justice, and climate change. I also examine related questions from a science and society perspective, drawing on mixed methods approaches alongside computational and network analysis techniques.</description>
