My research uses computational, spatial, quantitative, and historical methods to investigate pressing social-environmental questions, with a focus on inequality, urbanization, environmental justice, and climate change. I also examine related questions from a science and society perspective, drawing on mixed methods approaches alongside computational and network analysis techniques.\n+ e-mail: jonathan_tollefson@brown.edu\n+ ORCiD: 0000-0002-1392-5841\n+ I built this website using Hugo.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"","summary":"Bio # I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation and the Department of Sociology at the University of Chicago.","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":" Environments and Neighborhood Formation # My primary research investigates the formation and development of racial-environmental inequality in cities, linking spatial, quantitative, and computational and machine learning methods to produce novel longitudinal data. My dissertation presents the first analysis of urban environmental inequality in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, corresponding to the initial formation of neighborhood-scale racial segregation. This research is enabled by historical social-environmental data extraction techniques using a variety of computational methods (see this article on machine learning approaches to data extraction. In a case study of the Providence, RI, area, I find that environmental inequality shifted from a class-based phenomenon to one structured primarily by race and ethnicity, as residential segregation began to solidify at the neighborhood level at the turn of the 20th century (see this article). My dissertation extends this research to a comparative sample of US cities, and finds that racialization of environmental inequality emerged alongside and in relation to the formation of segregated and unequal neighborhoods.
