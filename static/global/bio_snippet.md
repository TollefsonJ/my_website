I'm a PhD candidate at the Brown University Department of Sociology and the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society. My research uses computational, spatial, and quantitative methods to investigate core sociological questions, with a focus on long-term trajectories of social and environmental change in cities. I also have an enduring interest in political ecology and science and technology studies.
